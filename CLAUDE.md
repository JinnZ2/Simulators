# Simulators

Repository for different simulations and supporting tooling.

## Layout

- `token-minimizer/` — Token compression tool design notes and a working
  `compress.py` implementation (Python stdlib only). Built around the
  "energy_english" compressed query format, local geometry references, and
  output-side delta compression.
- `emergence-stability-simulator/` — Notes and specification for a Monte
  Carlo test of stable vs. parasitic agent dynamics in multi-model
  emergence. Hypotheses, parameters, metrics, outputs, and a target repo
  structure live here.
- `research-stability-audit/` — Falsifiable-claim framework for testing
  research stability and AI model degradation. Six preset claims with
  measurement methods, thresholds, and cross-references to the
  emergence simulator's agent-level claims (same physics, different
  scale).
- `tools/` — Shared utilities. Currently `validate_claim_table.py`
  (lightweight schema validator for any `CLAIM_TABLE.json` produced in
  the repo; accepts both the `statement`/`status` and
  `hypothesis`/`is_falsified` flavours).
- `SYNTHESIS.md` — Top-level synthesis describing how the three folders
  fit together, how claims flow between them, and how to read the
  artifacts in order.
- Each simulator subfolder ships a `samples/` directory with one
  small representative output (CLAIM_TABLE, ASCII report, geometry
  file). Samples are checked in so the corpus is browsable on GitHub
  without running anything.

## Working branch

Active development happens on `claude/token-minimizer-emergence-sim-T4pjn`.
All changes for the token minimizer + emergence simulator scaffolding land
on that branch.

## Conventions

- Python files target the standard library only unless a note says
  otherwise.
- Notes files (`NOTES.md`) preserve design thinking as written so the
  reasoning is traceable; implementation files keep to what the notes
  specify.
- Each simulator subfolder is intended to be promotable to its own repo
  later (e.g. `emergence-stability-simulator` is sketched as a standalone
  CC0 repo in its notes).
